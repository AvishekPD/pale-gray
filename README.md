# pale-gray.THEME
Hello! Welcome to my pale-gray theme git.
I am no way know mean to use this place but I tried my best to make it ateast presentable.
For the polybar it's just archlabs default polybar you can find more about that on their forum page.
Feature about my theme it simplistic, easy to setup and does not distract during long works while looking not so ugly. 
Hope you like it ^-^ !
And I hope I lean how to use this github properly xD
